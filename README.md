# Tower Defense Game

Unfortunately, this ended up very unfinished. Time management is a bitch, right? Anyways, to play, **move the `map` file from the game folder into your your `worlds` folder and use that.**

KNOWN ISSUES I DIDNT HAVE TIME TO FIX
- Junctions don't work
- Turrets don't work
- Enemies spawn, but don't attack or get damaged. Instant-kill from punching

STUFF THAT DOES WORK
- Resources
- Cool custom hud
- Mining and conveyoring ores into the inputs
